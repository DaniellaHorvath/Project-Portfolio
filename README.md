# Project-Portfolio
Action Item:  Project Tasks
Directions: 

Your page will focus on four main areas:

1. Home Page
This landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, a mission statement, and something which defines you. Using a quote is a great idea, as well.
2. Bio Page
Your bio page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.
3. Experience Page
This should highlight your past experience, both professionally and academically. Include employers/schools as you might on a resume, and list accomplishments at each organization.
4. Portfolio Page
The meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you’ve worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web. Since we don’t have any projects to display yet, placeholder images/links/descriptions are completely fine.

Work towards checking off all of the following:

♢ You have a fully deployed website, and can share a link to it with the cohort.
♢ The project is committed and pushed to your Git Repo.
♢ The website features at least three pages (Home, Bio, Experience, Portfolio).
♢ The website contains a sufficient mixture of legitimate content, pictures, and         placeholders.
♢ The website is styled, having a discrete header, footer, and main content.
♢ There are links to each sub-page in the header.
♢ The site is visually appealing.
♢ The content is positioned appropriately (not overflowing into other portions of the site due to incorrect CSS).

♢ Attributes: name and value

♢ Headings (h1/h2/h3, etc.)
♢ Paragraphs

Extensions 
The sky is the limit here when completing the project. If you have the core elements complete, consider trying one or more of these challenges!

1. Media Queries: 
Currently your page is not designed to be responsive to different screen sizes (tablets, phones, large monitors, etc.). Research how to create @media rules that will utilize design rules only when screens are a certain size. Check out the video and code example in the Extension Resources folder for additional help!
    - Checkout the “Extensions Resources” folder for a lesson on media queries!

2. Incorporate some JavaScript functionality: Incorporate some JavaScript on your page that utilizes addEventListener and other basic JavaScript functionality. A few ideas to consider:
    - Have a button that reveals information for the user.
    - Alter the styling the page if they hover over a certain icon.
    - Create a form that captures the users information when they submit it. Log a message   informing the user that you have logged the data.

3. CSS Grid: Flexbox is just one way to organize content on the page. Research how to use CSS Grid and incorporate this in your webpage.

4. Bootstrap: Writing custom CSS rules takes a lot of time and is often not something web developers are going to write from scratch every time they make a new page. Research design libraries like Bootstrap that allow you to quickly style pages. Incorporate components from the library into your page.
